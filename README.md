# MobileApp6_Famous_Great_Romanians

Java app;

created in Android Studio

------------------------------------

I wanted to learn RecyclerView and CardView using something nice this time: on a small mobile application about Famous Romanians.

The selected ones would honor any people in the world.

Unfortunately, I did not know how to put some data about each of them. Perhaps I will continue the application in 1 month, when I know the basics of JBDC and Hibernate.

I admit I had another reason to insist a little on the appearance of the application.

Namely, the fact that my son has been telling me lately that he no longer wants to learn programming because he likes the design part of creating games more.

I think he is just lazy to learn.

With this, I wanted to show him that any programmer can make something beautiful (even if an artist knows how to improve it).

The basis is the programming, not the "packaging" of the program. For the design part, they will be a lot of professionals.

But where a lot of work and intellectual effort is required... he would not have much competition.

:-)
